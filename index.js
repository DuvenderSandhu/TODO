let quotes=`“Tears are words that need to be written.” - Paulo Coelho “And by and by Christopher Robin came to the end of things, and he was silent, and he sat there, looking out over the world, just wishing it wouldn't stop.” - A.A. Milne, The House at Pooh Corner “Live boldly. Push yourself. Don't settle.” - Jojo Moyes, Me Before You “I'm not in search of sanctity, sacredness, purity; these things are found after this life, not in this life; but in this life I search to be completely human: to feel, to give, to take, to laugh, to get lost, to be found, to dance, to love and to lust, to be so human.” - C. JoyBell C. “People are always telling me that i'm not like other girls...that i dont dress like other girls...that i dont act like other girls. But i'm my OWN person...i go to the beat of my own drum.” - Miley Cyrus “For too many centuries women have been being muses to artists. I wanted to be the muse, I wanted to be the wife of the artist, but I was really trying to avoid the final issue — that I had to do the job myself.” - Anaïs Nin “You save yourself or you remain unsaved.” - Alice Sebold “The rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened.” - John F. Kennedy “If people reach perfection they vanish, you know.” - T.H. White, The Once and Future King “My heart might be bruised, but it will recover and become capable of seeing beauty of life once more. It's happened before, it will happen again, I'm sure. When someone leaves, it's because someone else is about to arrive--I'll find love again.” - Paulo Coelho, The Zahir “We don’t truly appreciate what we have until it’s gone… We don’t really appreciate something until we have experienced some events; we don't really appreciate our parents until we ourselves have become parents. Be grateful for what you have now, and nothing should be taken for granted.” - Roy T. Bennett “People have to forgive. We don't have to like them, we don't have to be friends with them, we don't have to send them hearts in text messages, but we have to forgive them, to overlook, to forget. Because if we don't we are tying rocks to our feet, too much for our wings to carry!” - C. JoyBell C. “Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.” - Leo Buscaglia “It takes a huge effort to free yourself from memory” - Paulo Coelho, Aleph “Freedom is a heavy load, a great and strange burden for the spirit to undertake. It is not easy. It is not a gift given, but a choice made, and the choice may be a hard one. The road goes upward towards the light; but the laden traveler may never reach the end of it.” - Ursula K. LeGuin, The Tombs of Atuan “Keep your face always toward the sunshine - and shadows will fall behind you.” - Walt Whitman “The most important thing in life is to stop saying 'I wish' and start saying 'I will.' Consider nothing impossible, then treat possiblities as probabilities.” - Charles Dickens “I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime.” - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry “What the mind can conceive and believe, and the heart desire, you can achieve.” - Norman Vincent Peale “He who speaks without an attentive ear is mute.” - Stephen King, The Dark Tower “No matter how much experience you have, there’s always something new you can learn and room for improvement.” - Roy T. Bennett, The Light in the Heart “I remembered the fox. One runs the risk of crying a bit if one allows oneself to be tamed.” - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince “Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourslef or to gossip about others. Use your power of your word in the direction of truth and love.” - Don Miguel Ruiz, The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom “The culture of women in the church today is crippled by some very pervasive lies. "To be spiritual is to be busy. To be spiritual is to be disciplined. To be spiritual is to be dutiful." No, to be spiritual is to be in Romance with God. The desire to be romanced lies deep in the heart of every women. It is for such that you were made. Are you ARE romanced, and ever will be.” - John Elderedge “Everything is determined, the beginning as well as the end, by forces over which we have no control. It is determined for the insect, as well as for the star. Human beings, vegetables, or cosmic dust, we all dance to a mysterious tune, intoned in the distance by an invisible piper.” - Albert Einstein “I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings.” - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry “There is no limit to the amount of good you can do if you don't care who gets the credit.” - Ronald Reagan “The strongest people find the courage and caring to help others, even if they are going through their own storm.” - Roy T. Bennett, The Light in the Heart “The best things in life make you sweaty.” - Edgar Allan Poe “With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,it is still a beautiful world.Be cheerful.Strive to be happy.” - Max Ehrmann, Desiderata: A Poem for a Way of Life “The ugly and stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit at their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all should live-- undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They never bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands. Your rank and wealth, Henry; my brains, such as they are-- my art, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray's good looks-- we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.” - Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray “There are some things that it is better to begin than to refuse, even though the end may be dark.” - J.R.R. Tolkien, The Two Towers “At the moment of commitment the entire universe conspires to assist you.” - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe “The whole summer lay ahead of us-time to rest, time to wait. And when the future comes-no matter what comes with it-I'll be smarter. I'll be stronger. I'll be ready.” - Ally Carter, Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy “What's terrible is to pretend that second-rate is first-rate. To pretend that you don't need love when you do; or you like your work when you know quite well you're capable of better.” - Doris Lessing, The Golden Notebook “When I try, I fail. When I trust, He succeeds.” - Corrie ten Boom “Surround Yourself with People Who Believe in Your Dreams:Surround yourself with people who believe in your dreams, encourage your ideas, support your ambitions, and bring out the best in you.” - Roy T. Bennett, The Light in the Heart “I think that one of these days," he said, "you're going to have to find out where you want to go. And then you've got to start going there. But immediately. You can't afford to lose a minute. Not you.” - J.D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye “I'm often asked what I think about as I run. Usually the people who ask this have never run long distances themselves. I always ponder the question. What exactly do I think about when I'm running? I don't have a clue.” - Haruki Murakami, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running “Don’t waste your time in anger, regrets, worries, and grudges. Life is too short to be unhappy.” - Roy T. Bennett “I don't think you should wait. I think you should speak now.” - Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift: Speak Now “When I was little and running on the race track at school, I always stopped and waited for all the other kids so we could run together even though I knew (and everybody else knew) that I could run much faster than all of them! I pretended to read slowly so I could "wait" for everyone else who couldn't read as fast as I could! When my friends were short I pretended that I was short too and if my friend was sad I pretended to be unhappy. I could go on and on about all the ways I have limited myself, my whole life, by "waiting" for people. And the only thing that I've ever received in return is people thinking that they are faster than me, people thinking that they can make me feel bad about myself just because I let them and people thinking that I have to do whatever they say I should do. My mother used to teach me "Cinderella is a perfect example to be" but I have learned that Cinderella can go fuck herself, I'm not waiting for anybody, anymore! I'm going to run as fast as I can, fly as high as I can, I am going to soar and if you want you can come with me! But I'm not waiting for you anymore.” - C. JoyBell C. “With your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet, you're too smart to go down any not-so-good street.” - Dr. Seuss “The amazing thing is that every atom in your body came from a star that exploded. And, the atoms in your left hand probably came from a different star than your right hand. It really is the most poetic thing I know about physics: You are all stardust. You couldn’t be here if stars hadn’t exploded, because the elements - the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, all the things that matter for evolution - weren’t created at the beginning of time. They were created in the nuclear furnaces of stars, and the only way they could get into your body is if those stars were kind enough to explode. So, forget Jesus. The stars died so that you could be here today.” - Lawrence M. Krauss, A Universe from Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing “Keep a little fire burning; however small, however hidden.” - Cormac McCarthy, The Road “You can't do anything about the length of your life, but you can do something about its width and depth.” - H. L. Mencken “There are several ways to react to being lost. One is to panic: this was usually Valentina's first impulse. Another is to abandon yourself to lostness, to allow the fact that you've misplaced yourself to change the way you experience the world.” - Audrey Niffenegger, Her Fearful Symmetry “Deep down, I don’t believe it takes any special talent for a person to lift himself off the ground and hover in the air. We all have it in us—every man, woman, and child—and with enough hard work and concentration, every human being is capable of…the feat….You must learn to stop being yourself. That’s where it begins, and everything else follows from that. You must let yourself evaporate. Let your muscles go limp, breathe until you feel your soul pouring out of you, and then shut your eyes. That’s how it’s done. The emptiness inside your body grows lighter than the air around you. Little by little, you begin to weigh less than nothing. You shut your eyes; you spread your arms; you let yourself evaporate. And then, little by little, you lift yourself off the ground.Like so.” - Paul Auster, Mr. Vertigo “The nights you fight best arewhen all the weapons are pointed at you,when all the voices hurl their insultswhile the dream is being strangled.The nights you fight best arewhen reason gets kicked in the gut,when the chariots of gloom encircle you.The nights you fight best arewhen the laughter of fools fills the air,when the kiss of death is mistaken for love.The nights you fight best arewhen the game is fixed,when the crowd screams for your blood.The nights you fight best areon a night like thisas you chase a thousand dark rats from your brain,as you rise up against the impossible,as you become a brother to the tender sister of joyand move on regardless.” - Charles Bukowski “But life is a battle: may we all be enabled to fight it well!” - Charlotte Brontë, The Letters of Charlotte Brontë`
